# Bank_Customer_Churn_Prediction
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn in the banking industry. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a company or service provider. In the context of the banking industry, customer churn occurs when customers close their accounts or switch to a different bank.

In this project, we aim to build machine learning models that can accurately predict customer churn based on various customer attributes. These attributes may include demographic information (such as age, gender, and location), account-related details (such as account balance, transaction history, and tenure), and other relevant factors that may influence customer behavior.
